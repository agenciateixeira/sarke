# Placeholder - Replace with actual ringback tone MP3
# This file needs to be replaced with a real MP3 audio file
# Ringback is the sound the caller hears while waiting for answer
# You can download free sounds from sites like:
# - https://www.zapsplat.com
# - https://freesound.org
# - https://www.soundjay.com

# For now, the application will use a fallback beep sound
